            <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
            <p>Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery
                and many
                waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by boat is
                common. On
                the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern India, is home to
                the royal
                Bengal tiger.</p>
